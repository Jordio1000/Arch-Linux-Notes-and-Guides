# Arch-Linux-Notes-and-Guides
This is a place for me to store my notes and guides on my experiences with Arch Linux. Below you will find links to any guides I have written as well as some more free flowing notes that I feel are helpful.

DISCLAIMER: I am not an Arch Linux expert nor do I claim to be one. I am just an unemployed Systems Administrator who wanted to switch to daily driving Linux and decided to make it a bit of a project by learning Arch Linux. This was my first time installing and using Arch and I just decided to document the process from what I learned through trial and error. Please do not treat this guide as gospel and do your own research on what configurations work best for you. One of the main things I learned from this experience is that there are many different ways to achieve the same goal and they all can be valid for their own reason. Thank you for reading this guide and I hope you get some use out of it 🙂.
